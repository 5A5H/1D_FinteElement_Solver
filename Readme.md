# FEM_1D_SOLVER A one dimensional finite element solver, written in Python for educational purpose
The Program represents a very simple 1D finite element solver. It is written in completely in python,
with ```numpy``` and ```matplotlib``` as the only dependencies of the environment.
Hence it should be easy to be used.

Although the program is very simple, it allows for multiple nodal degrees of freedom,
and time dependent analysis.

The program relies on a single class definition which represents a simulation, acompanied with an exchangeable finite element file.
